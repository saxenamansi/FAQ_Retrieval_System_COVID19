# QA_System_COVID19

In these desperate times of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the public has complete knowledge in all areas pertaining to this ubiquitous virus so that they can protect themselves and their loved ones. They must constantly be updated about any new research findings on the subject or government guidelines. However, in the mix of this panic and confusion, it is easy for fake news to circulate. In this project, this is the problem that we attempt to find a solution for. We have built a Covid-19 FAQ retrieval system that is trained on a manually created question-answer dataset from the FAQ pages of government websites and other reliable sources with expert answers. We attempt to build a common platform for all the Covid-19 relevant queries that users might have and to provide them with reliable and accurate answers. This way, the spreading of fake news can be curbed. In this project, we build five models to achieve this goal and compare the FAQs obtained in each model to see which retrieves the most reliable data pertaining to the question. Using the Kaggle Covid-19 FAQ dataset for evaluating the five models built, we observed that the BERT encodings model retrieves the most reliable and relevant information.
